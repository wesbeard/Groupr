# Groupr

A simple tab grouping extension for the Firefox web browser that allows for a better web workflow  
Created by Wes Beard and Josh Bogin for CSI-330

## Features

- Create named tab groups to save your currently open tabs tabs
- Once a group is selected a list of context buttons is shown that relate to that current group
- Open all tabs in the group in a new window, preserving pins and other preferences
- Save the currently open tabs as the selected group, allowing them to be reopened later

#### Extras:

- Quickly organize your tabs by domain using a button at the top of the extension
- Schedule times when certain saved windows will open to coincide with the start or end of that workflow

## Installation:

- Clone the repository to a folder you can locate easily
- Open Firefox and enter `about:debugging`as a URL
- This should open the Firefox debugging panel
- Select the left button labeled `The Firefox`
- Select `Load Temporary Add-on...`
- Choose any of the core files (such as `groupr.html`)
- The extension should now be loaded!
- Navigate to `about:addons` to see that it installed correctly
